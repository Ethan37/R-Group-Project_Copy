# team-project

## Welcome!

This is the repository for all files and documents related to the final Team Project of **STA 418/518**. This class from Grand Valley State University is designed to teach students statistical skills and data science in R. For this class, we are required to be proficient in git and GitHub in order to clone, edit, and collaborate on projects in R.

These files serve as templates/canvases for this taks. As work is done on the task, these files will change according to the instructions, with the final report and presentation being ready Thursday December 12th 2019. If today's date is at or beyond this point, you should be viewing the final version of this repository. Otherwise, the repository might still be under development. This final will specifically focus on the use of all of our knowledge of R to analyze our dataset of interest in a unique way.
